Outcome Engineering is a methodology for building software with AI agents. The **Spec Tree** is a git-native product structure where each node co-locates a spec, its tests, and a lock file — tracking not just what changed, but what has been validated and whether that validation is still current.

## The Spec Tree

Every node begins with an outcome hypothesis — a belief about what change it will produce. Assertions define testable claims. Lock files use Git blob hashes to make drift visible before anyone runs a test.
