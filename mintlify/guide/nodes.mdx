Every node in the Spec Tree contains a spec, its tests, and a lock file. The spec file inside each node is `{slug}.md` — no type suffix, no numeric prefix.

## Outcome nodes

Outcome specs start with `## Outcome` — a hypothesis about what change the node will produce:

```markdown title="status-rollup.md"
## Outcome

We believe that aggregating child node states into a parent status
will let developers identify stale subtrees without inspecting
each node individually.

### Assertions

- A parent with all valid children reports valid ([test](tests/status.unit.test.ts))
- A parent with any stale child reports stale ([test](tests/status.unit.test.ts))
- A parent with any needs-work child needs work ([test](tests/status.unit.test.ts))
```

Every assertion links to the test file meant to prove it — the `spx` CLI parses the Markdown AST to extract these links. The invariant: **every assertion must be covered by at least one test file.**

The human writes the hypothesis and its assertions; the agent writes the tests and implementation to prove them.

## Enabler nodes

Enabler specs start with `## Enables` — describing what infrastructure this node provides and which nodes depend on it.

## Cross-cutting assertions

When a behavior spans multiple nodes, the assertion lives in the **lowest common ancestor**. The ancestor's spec captures cross-cutting behaviors; child nodes handle their local concerns. If an ancestor accumulates too many cross-cutting assertions, that is a signal to extract a shared enabler at a lower index.

## Decision records

**PDRs** (Product Decision Records) establish product constraints — pricing, compliance, retention — that must hold across a subtree.

**ADRs** (Architecture Decision Records) capture technical choices. The human makes the decision; agents create the record and propagate changes through dependent nodes.

Decision records sit as files in each directory, discoverable without opening any subdirectory.
