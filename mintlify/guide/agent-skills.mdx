description: "Three skill layers that coordinate how agents work within the Spec Tree."
---

Agent skills are organized in three layers that ensure agents have the right context before doing work, and validate their output afterward.

## Three layers

### Foundation (load once per conversation)

Foundation skills load methodology and validate context. They emit markers that action skills check before proceeding.

- **understanding-spx** — Loads methodology, structure, and templates
- **contextualizing-spx** — Ingests and validates the target artifact

### Action (do the work)

Action skills execute workflows. Each checks for foundation markers before proceeding.

- **authoring-spx** — Create and extend specs
- **decomposing-spx** — Decompose nodes into children
- **refactoring-spx** — Structural moves and re-scoping
- **aligning-spx** — Clarify, augment, align, deconflict

### Contract (validate output)

Contract skills synchronize spec-test consistency after action skills complete.

- **testing-spx** — Ensures specs and tests are in agreement

## Conversational flow

All action skills follow a consistent flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Intake">
    Understand what the user wants.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Foundation gate">
    Verify methodology is loaded (check markers).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Target context gate">
    Verify target artifacts are loaded.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan">
    Design the approach.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute">
    Do the work.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contract gate">
    Invoke testing-spx to validate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deliver">
    Present results to the user.
  </Step>
</Steps>
