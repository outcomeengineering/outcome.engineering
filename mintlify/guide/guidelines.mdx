description: "Three practical guidelines that follow from agents' inability to participate in conversations that produce tacit knowledge."

These are not abstractions; they are practical consequences of the fact that agents cannot participate in the conversations that produce tacit knowledge.

## Always be converging

> Iterate on a durable artifact in small, reviewable steps such that each step is reversible and repeatable, and each reduces uncertainty about what the system should do.

Agents will get things wrong. Because every agent starts from the spec — not the implementation — mistakes do not compound: go back one step, try again with a different prompt or a different agent, and the spec anchors the retry.

## Determinism unless creation is the goal

> Never generate what can be derived deterministically.

If you know what you want the agent to base its actions on, provide it as deterministic context and keep it from grepping the codebase. Wherever a deterministic mechanism can replace a probabilistic one, use it:

- Curate context rather than letting agents search the codebase
- Link traceability explicitly rather than inferring it
- Let pre-commit hooks catch what agent judgment would miss
- Reserve the generative capacity of agents for the parts that require it

Global and local constraints — PDRs and ADRs — must be co-located with the specs they apply to.

## Ask what matters

> Expose the maximum leverage decisions, let the agent handle the rest.

Any operational system must expose the highest leverage decisions to a human — either ex ante or ex post — and use the industriousness of agents to update all dependent decisions when you change them. The structure must separate intended behavior (spec) from whether that behavior holds (tests + lock file).
