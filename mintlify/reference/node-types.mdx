## Product file

The root of every Spec Tree. Filename: `{product-name}.product.md`.

Captures why the product should exist and what change in user behavior it aims to achieve.

## Enabler nodes

**Directory suffix:** `.enabler`

Enabler nodes provide infrastructure that higher-index nodes depend on. They would be removed if all their dependents were retired.

**Spec file convention:** `{slug}.md` starting with `## Enables`.

```text
21-test-harness.enabler/
├── test-harness.md          # starts with ## Enables
└── tests/
    └── test-harness.unit.test.ts
```

## Outcome nodes

**Directory suffix:** `.outcome`

Outcome nodes express one hypothesis and the testable assertions that define its output.

**Spec file convention:** `{slug}.md` starting with `## Outcome`.

```text
43-status-rollup.outcome/
├── status-rollup.md          # starts with ## Outcome
├── spx-lock.yaml
└── tests/
    └── status.unit.test.ts
```

## Decision records

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

**Filename:** `{index}-{slug}.adr.md`

Technical choices that constrain implementation. ADRs sit as files within directories alongside the nodes they constrain.

### PDR (Product Decision Record)

**Filename:** `{index}-{slug}.pdr.md`

Product constraints — pricing, compliance, retention — that must hold across a subtree.

### Scope

A decision at a given index constrains every sibling with a higher index and that sibling's descendants. Decisions at the same index are independent of each other.
