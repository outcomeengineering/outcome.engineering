## Numeric prefix (index)

Every node and decision record has a numeric prefix that encodes dependency order within its directory. Lower index = dependency for higher-index siblings.

```text
├── 15-tree-structure-contract.pdr.md    # constrains everything ≥ 21
├── 15-cli-framework.adr.md              # same index: independent of PDR above
├── 21-test-harness.enabler/             # constrained by index 15
├── 32-parse-directory-tree.enabler/     # constrained by indices 15, 21
```

Items at the same index are independent of each other.

## Sparse integer distribution

Prefixes use a sparse integer distribution to predictably space nodes and absorb future insertions. For an expected maximum of N nodes in a two-digit range (10–99):

$$i_k = 10 + \left\lfloor k \times \frac{89}{N+1} \right\rfloor$$

| N | Sequence |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | 32, 54, 76 |
| 5 | 24, 39, 54, 69, 84 |
| 7 | 21, 32, 43, 54, 65, 76, 87 |

## Fractional indexing

An escape hatch when a gap is fully exhausted. To insert between index 21 and 22:

```text
20.5-integration-harness.enabler/
```

Fractional indices sort correctly in filesystem browsers and avoid cascading renumbering.

## Scope

Indices are unique among siblings only. The same index can appear at different levels of the tree. Combined with the slug, each node is uniquely identifiable within its directory.
