## Directory naming

```
{index}-{slug}.{type}/
```

- **index**: Numeric prefix (sparse integer distribution)
- **slug**: Kebab-case descriptive name
- **type**: `enabler` or `outcome`

Examples:
```text
21-test-harness.enabler/
54-spx-tree-interpretation.outcome/
```

## Spec file naming

The spec file inside each node is `{slug}.md` — no type suffix, no numeric prefix.

```text
21-test-harness.enabler/
└── test-harness.md           # not "21-test-harness.enabler.md"
```

## Decision record naming

```
{index}-{slug}.adr.md        # Architecture Decision Record
{index}-{slug}.pdr.md        # Product Decision Record
```

Decision records sit as files within their directory, not as subdirectories.

## Product file naming

```
{product-name}.product.md
```

At the root of the `spx/` directory.

## Test directory

Each node has a `tests/` subdirectory:

```text
43-status-rollup.outcome/
├── status-rollup.md
├── spx-lock.yaml
└── tests/
    └── status.unit.test.ts
```

## Test file naming

```
{name}.unit.test.{ext}
{name}.integration.test.{ext}
{name}.e2e.test.{ext}
```

## Lock file

```
spx-lock.yaml
```

One per node directory, at the same level as the spec file.
